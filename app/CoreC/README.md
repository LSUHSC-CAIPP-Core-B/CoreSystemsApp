## Introduction
Advancements in flow cytometry technology have enabled a growing array of antibody and fluorochrome combinations for scientific inquiry. However, this expanded capability brings technical and financial challenges. The upfront investment in antibodies and panels can be prohibitive, discouraging experimentation. As more labs adopt flow cytometry, redundancy and waste in antibody use increase. Our solution, integrated within an immunophenotyping core facility, addresses these issues by facilitating cost-sharing and easing financial barriers. We have developed a user-friendly computer program tailored to our campus environment for antibody sharing and tracking.
